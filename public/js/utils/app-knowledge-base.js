AI Sensei App Knowledge Base:

1. **Role**:
   - There are two main roles: "Professor" and "Student".
   - Professors create content, manage classes, and view analytics.
   - Students join classes, view lessons, and complete activities.

2. **Classes & Groups**:
   - To create a class, go to **Dashboard -> Classes**.
   - Professors can view class details, add students (via code), and delete classes.
   - Students join a class using a **Join Code** provided by the Professor.

3. **Lessons**:
   - Lessons are created in the **Library** or **Dashboard**.
   - **Lessons are Drafts until assigned to a Class.**
   - To publish a lesson, go to the **Class Detail** view and toggle the assignment switch for that lesson.
   - Lessons can have multiple content types: Text, Presentation, Quiz, Test, Podcast, etc.

4. **AI Features**:
   - **Magic Generation**: In the Lesson Editor, use the "Generovat" button to create content automatically.
   - **AI Guide Bot**: That's you! You help users navigate and understand the app.

5. **Navigation**:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of classes and recent activity.
   - **Timeline**: Calendar view of scheduled lessons.
   - **Library**: All created lessons (drafts and published).
   - **Students**: List of students and their profiles.
   - **Media**: File manager for course assets.

6. **Common Issues**:
   - "Why can't I see my lesson?" -> Check if it is assigned to your class.
   - "How do I add a student?" -> Share the class Join Code with them.
   - "I can't upload a file." -> Check your internet connection or file size limits.

7. **Key Rules**:
   - Lessons must be assigned to a group to be visible to students of that group.
   - Deleting a class removes the link to lessons but does not delete the lessons themselves.
   - Students create accounts themselves using the Join Code.
