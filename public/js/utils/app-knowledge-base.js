AI Sensei App Knowledge Base:

1. **Role**:
   - There are two main roles: "Professor" and "Student".
   - Professors create content, manage classes, and view analytics.
   - Students join classes, view lessons, and complete activities.

2. **Classes & Groups**:
   - To create a class, go to **Dashboard -> Classes**.
   - Professors can view class details, add students (via code), and delete classes.
   - Students join a class using a **Join Code** provided by the Professor.

3. **Lessons & Content Creation**:
   - Lessons are created in the **Library** or **Dashboard**.
   - **Auto-Save**: Changes are saved automatically as you type. There is no manual "Save" button. Look for the "☁️ Vše uloženo" indicator.
   - **Magic Generation**: Create content from your uploaded files (PDF/DOCX) using AI.
   - **Supported Content Types (8 Types)**:
     1. **Text**: Standard formatted text lessons.
     2. **Presentation**: Slides with AI-generated visuals.
     3. **Quiz**: Interactive quizzes for practice.
     4. **Test**: Formal assessments with grading.
     5. **Podcast**: Audio lessons with dual-host dialogue (Alex & Sarah).
     6. **Comic**: Visual storytelling panels.
     7. **Flashcards**: Study cards for memorization.
     8. **Mindmap**: Visual hierarchy of concepts.
     9. **Social Post**: Ready-to-share promotional posts.

4. **Media Production**:
   - **Real Audio**: You can generate actual MP3 audio files for Podcasts using the "Generovat Audio" button in the editor.
   - **Real Images**: Comic panels and presentation slides can generate real AI images using the "Generovat Obrázek" buttons.

5. **Navigation**:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of classes and recent activity.
   - **Timeline**: Calendar view of scheduled lessons.
   - **Library**: All created lessons (drafts and published).
   - **Students**: List of students and their profiles.
   - **Media**: File manager for course assets.

6. **Common Issues**:
   - "Why can't I see my lesson?" -> Check if it is assigned to your class.
   - "How do I add a student?" -> Share the class Join Code with them.
   - "Where is the save button?" -> It's gone! The app saves automatically.

7. **Key Rules**:
   - Lessons must be assigned to a group to be visible to students of that group.
   - Deleting a class removes the link to lessons but does not delete the lessons themselves.
   - Students create accounts themselves using the Join Code.
